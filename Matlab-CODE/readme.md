# Matlab code is used to prepare the training, testing and reconstruct whole-brain data for dMRI-TOD used in python code.

### generate-training.m is the code to prepare the training .npy format dataset, that is the input to python code, used in train.py.
### generate-test.m is the code to prepare to test dMRI in .npy format for TOD prediction, used in test.py.
### generate-test-Recon.m will reconstruct the 3d TOD map from the result generated by python test.py.
