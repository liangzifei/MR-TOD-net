# MR-TOD-net
MR-TOD is to predict the voxel_wise axonal orientations distribution(TOD) from RAW diffusion MRI signals using deep learning

## How to use MR-TOD-Net?
1. Predict the TOD from diffusion MRI without training:

Use our trained deep neural networks to predict FOD from RAW diffusion MRI signals, by input the same graindient scanned data.
