# MR-TOD-net
MR-TOD is to predict the voxel_wise axonal orientations distribution(TOD) from RAW diffusion MRI signals using deep learning

# How to use MR-TOD-Net?
Use our trained deep neural networks to predict FOD from RAW diffusion MRI signals, by input the same graindient scanned data.



    Register your own mouse brain MRI data to the MRI dataset provided here and use the source codes to train your own networks.
    Register your own histological data to the MRI dataset provided here and use the source codes to train your own network. Note: co-register histological and MRI data is time consuming.
    Register data acquired using new MRI methods to the MRI dataset provided here and test its sensitivity and specificity using the histological data as the ground truth.
